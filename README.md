Time series analysis is an important topic in data science, and understanding the fundamentals of time series analysis is a useful skill for a data scientist to master. 
In this project I analyze time series data collected from an automated bicycle counter installed at Fremont Bridge in Seattle. The dataset can be downloaded from http://data.seattle.gov. 

My main goal in this project was to get insights from the data about the bicycle traffic patterns. By cleaning the data and using plotting tools from Pandas I found a few important patterns of the bicycle traffic at Fremont Bridge in Seattle:

1) There are seasonal variations in the traffic, more traffic in summer months compared to winter ones.
2) The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the cycling traffic can be clearly observed starting in early 2020. 
3) The traffic has different patterns in weekdays and weekends.
4) The weekday traffic is mostly due to commiting to and from work.
