# Seattle-Bicycle-Counts
Time series analysis is an important topic in data science, and understanding the fundamentals of time series analysis is a useful skill for a data scientist to master. 
Here I will be analyzing time series data that were collected from an automated bicycle counter installed at Fremont Bridge in Seattle. The dataset can be downloaded from http://data.seattle.gov. 

My main goal in this project to get insights about the traffic patterns: 
- Is there a seasonal component of the traffic?
- How does the traffic vary with time of the day? 
- How does the traffic differ between weekdays and weekend?
- What are other critical factors that may affect the traffic?
